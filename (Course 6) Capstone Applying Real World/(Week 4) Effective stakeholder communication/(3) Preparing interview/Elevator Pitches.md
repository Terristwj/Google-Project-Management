2. Hello,

   - my name is John Doe and it was till recently that i fell head first into project management. I have 5 years of Biotech and lab work experience and have always operated in a structured and organized manner. Over the years i have worked on a multitude of projects without realizing i was indeed leading the projects. I organized meetings and communicated across departments. When my team ran into problems i communicated with senior stakeholders and found out ways get over or through hurdles. My favorite part of projects is working with a team to achieve a common goal and when we achieve it seeing the end product. What are some of the hurdles most project managers see here?
